# PDF_RAG_FILE
The goal is to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that allows users to interact with semi-structured data in multiple PDF files. The system should extract, chunk, embed and store the data for efficient retrieval. This system will answer user queries and perform comparisons accurately, using LLM model for generating responses.
